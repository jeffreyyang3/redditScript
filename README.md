A script for browsing reddit through the command line.
To run:
Navigate to the directory and run the redditscript.py with python3 redditscript.py (I haven't tested it with python 2)
You may need to install urllib3.
This script is in a preliminary stage and there may be bugs. Please let me know about bugs if you find them.
