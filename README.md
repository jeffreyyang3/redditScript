A script for browsing reddit through the command line.
To run:
Navigate to the directory and run redditscript.py with python3 redditscript.py
You may need to install urllib3.
If you can't, you can run the script in directory notUrllib3. However, it's less stable.
This script is in a preliminary stage and there may be bugs. Please let me know about bugs if you find them.
